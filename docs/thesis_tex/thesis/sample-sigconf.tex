\begin{abstract}
After a company files for bankruptcy at the court, a court committee will appoint a curator to settle the bankruptcy. The curator dissolves the company by monetizing the company's estate and redeeming its creditors. A courtâ€™s judge supervises the curator. Both these processes: curator appointment and supervision, have been topic of research[1-2], have raised concerns in the media[13-21] and have lead to court cases for not being transparent and/or not being adequate.

In this thesis an information system prototype will be constructed to shed light on these processes. The system takes in the structured and unstructered data of the insolvency procedures using open and publicly available data sources[22-28]. From this data the system builds and annotates a complete linked entity structure.

Using a [web application] interface, a stakeholder can query and explore the networks of linked entities and insolvency case data in order to provide transparency on the insolvency processes.
