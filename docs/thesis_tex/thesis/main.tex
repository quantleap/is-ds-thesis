\begin{abstract}
When a company files for bankruptcy at the court, a court committee will appoint a curator to settle the bankruptcy. The curator dissolves the company by monetizing the company's estate and redeeming its creditors. A court's judge supervises the curator. 

Both these processes: 1. curator appointment and 2. curator supervision, have been topic of research[1-2], have raised concerns in the media[13-21] and have lead to court cases for not being transparent and/or not being adequate.

The Dutch government has initiated a transparency program for the legal system using on-line forms to retrieve specific data and open data sources with technical APIs. But open data alone does not provide the open analysis that enables armchair auditing.

In this thesis an information system prototype will be developed to enable the auditing of insolvency processes. The system takes in relevant structured and unstructured data of insolvency procedures using open and publicly available data sources[22-28]. From this data the system builds and annotates a complete linked entity structure and makes it searchable. With a user friendly interface, a stakeholder can query and explore the linked data in order to explore insolvency processes and answer specific questions.
