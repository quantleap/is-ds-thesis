abstract
========
The Dutch government is taking steps to disclose data financed by public funds. The law states that jurisdiction should be public but in practise often only selected court decisions are published. There are subfields such as insolvency law where currently all court actions are published. The government supplies minimal functinality to retrieve court publications and accompanying curator reports *if* the curator filed them. There is lacking structure in this data to facilitate exploratory search. Furthermore much of the data resides in PDFs and text fields which makes binary keyword search and full-text search unavailable.

In this thesis project a complex information system prototype will be proposed to 1. retrieve obscured information and knowledge from the open Dutch insolvency data and 2. add structure to this data to facilitate exploratory search and advanced text search for purposes of exploration, retrieval, analytics and process mining.
