\subsection{Description of Data Sources}
\subsubsection{Central Insolvency Register}
\paragraph{Data suppliers}
The CIR contains company insolvency data supplied by the courts and the administrators. Courts are obliged to supply the insolvency data and free consultation thereof according to the insolvency law, article 19 \cite{law:1}. CIR contains insolvency cases from the 1st of January 2005 and retains these until six months after their end date. CIR also contains other data such as personal debt restructuring (\textit{schuldsanering}), personal insolvency and company's failure to pay (\textit{surseance}) but this data is out of scope.

\paragraph{Entity records}
The CIR register contains the following entities in numbers of records (as of 2019-03-21):

\begin{table}[h]
\caption{number of entity records.}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{l r r}
\hline\hline
Entity & no. of records\\
\hline
Court & 11 \\
Supervisory Judge (distinct names) & 580 \\
Insolvency & 51,392 \\
Administrator (distinct names) & 58,201 \\
Publication & 142,172 \\
Report & 357,803 \\
... progress report & 237,657 \\
... financial attachment. & 120,146 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\label{table:cir_contents}
\end{table}

Publications on an insolvency case are done by the court and include the initial declaration of bankruptcy. Administrators periodically submit progress reports as well as financial attachments to the CIR.

\paragraph{Entity identifiers}
CIR entity data is made available by a SOAP web service returning XML responses. The XML is semi structured data and contains entities by composition which are extracted using a parser. It provides natural unique identifiers for Insolvency Cases, Publications and Reports	so they can be easily stored in normalized SQL tables and linked. The other entities: Courts, Judges and Administrators have no identifiers but consist of free text fields for their name parts. These entities must be de-duplicated en linked to a master data record. It can be easily observed in table \ref{table:cir_contents} that this is certainly needed for administrators \todo[inline]{state estimated number of administrators}.

\paragraph{Entity relations}
Figure \ref{fig:cir-erd} below shows the relationships between the entities including their cardinality. Note that some relationships are time dependent, e.g. a judge can be replaced during the lifetime of an insolvency case. Since 1-1-2019 there can be two judges appointed to one case.

\paragraph{Administrator reports}
A second web service operated by CIR provides administrator reports in PDF format. These reports hold much of the unstructured data. Recofa has published templates for both progress and financial attachment reports \cite{rechtspraak:recofa} which provide a certain structure to the contents.

\subsubsection{Register of lawyers, NOvA Tableau}\label{NOvA Tableau}
The NOvA tableau is the official register for lawyers and maintained by the \textit{Nederlandse Orde van Advocaten (NOvA)}\cite{nova:1}. Lawyers are obliged to be registered in the tableau by the lawyer's law (\textit{advocatenwet}, article 1 \cite{law:2}). NOvA offers an on-line search form where keyword search and filters can be applied to search for a lawyer. This data source was chosen to collect the master data for Administrators. 

\subsubsection{Register of judges, Nevenfuncties van rechters}\label{Nevenfuncties Rechters}
The Register for ancillary positions for judges is made available by \textit{de Rechtspraak}\cite{rechtspraak:nevenfuncties}. It offers an on-line form and returns the name, current and historical occupation and ancillary positions. This data source was chosen to collect the master data for Judges.
