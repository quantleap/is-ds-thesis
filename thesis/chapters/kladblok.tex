The Entity Linker
It does this by normalization of the CIR names and resolving them to the register entities using similarity functions. Unresolved entities can be linked manually to guarantee completeness. Established links are stored in an association table. After an initial run, the register scrapers are called upon only when new judges or administrators entries appear in CIR.
